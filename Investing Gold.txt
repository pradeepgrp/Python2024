My 1,770 sell target was achieved yesterday as the price closed below the (H)4 MA50 as mentioned on my last statement. 
Now Gold is showcasing its bullish momentum once as as it broke above the (H)4 MA50 following a rebound 
on the 1,760 Support (made off the October 18th low). 
(D) is neutral once more (RSI # 53.972, MACD # 2.490, ADX # 28.694) and I am expecting this reversal 
to target 1,810 and 1,820 in extension as a Higher High. 
Keep in mind that the Fed Decision is playing a huge part in this and as it is a long-term macro, 
most likely this trend is here to stay as they plan on a more controlled taper strategy. 
The US10Y is on a bearish reversal (H&amp;S) which is bullish for Gold and basically the only sell pressure is coming from 
the (still) strong DXY. I expect the NFP tomorrow to be the catalyst for the USD's trend.

It's a SHORT to 1783-1790 spot range, THEN it's a buy at that level for 1865

11/15 - George Gold

Gold has so far failed to break above the key 1,870 (on XAUUSD) pivot line of 2020 and is technically forming a top 
which can be the Higher High on the (D) Bullish Megaphone that started after the September 29th low. 
(H)1 is turning neutral (RSI # 56.083, MACD # 0.380, ADX # 17.799) which is a natural reaction on peak formations 
and I personally expect (within a weekly horizon) a pull-back towards the (D) MA200 (around 1,800), 
which should be turned into a Support if this one month bullish move is to be transfered on the long-term as well. 
Then my target will be 1,910. Note that currently it is the DXY which keeps Gold that high, 
as the US10Y, though bearish on the long-term, rebounded on its (D)MA200.

Gold has so far failed to close a (D) candle above the 1876 Symmetrical Resistance but technically remains bullish (RSI # 66.354, MACD # 23.900, ADX # 45.046). 
In order however to extend this bullish trend, a (D) candle needs to be closed above the 1,875 pivot and if it does, 
the natural targets would be first 1,917 (Resistance 1 from the June 1st High) and if a (D) candle closes above it, 
then 1,938.50 (0.5 Fibonacci of the two Resistance levels: 1,960 and 1,917). 
On the other hand, if a (D) candle closes below the 1,843.50 short-term Support, I would expect a technical pull-back to its long-term Support, 
the 1D MA50 (blue trend-line). 
Long-term though I remain bullish as within the next days the (D) chart will form a Golden Cross. 
Fundamentally today's higher that expected Initial Jobless Claims should be bearish on the short-term

Golden Cross:
The golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the upside and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market. 
Some analysts define it as a crossover of the 100-day moving average by the 50-day moving average; others define it as the crossover of the 200-day average by the 50-day average.

EMA vs SMA:
The primary difference between an EMA and an SMA is the sensitivity each one shows to changes in the data used in its calculation. ... 
More specifically, the exponential moving average gives a higher weighting to recent prices, while the simple moving average assigns equal weighting to all values.

Remember always be ready to cover the losses and trade short/medium-term break-outs of the trend. Set markers on correlating assets that can serve as an early warning. =>(Bond, USD etc.).
"Don't overcommit", go for safe short-term profits in this environment, one bad trade can always be gained back another time but a liquidated account cannot.
